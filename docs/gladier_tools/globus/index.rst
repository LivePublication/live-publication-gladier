Globus Tools
============

Globus Tools map to the list of `Globus Maintained Action
Providers <https://globus-automate-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/globus_action_providers.html>`_

They may not even contain Comptue functions, but are rather a convenient way to add
common flow operations to your Gladier Client without copying the JSON yourself.
