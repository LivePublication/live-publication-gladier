Installation
============

Gladier requires Python 3.6 and higher. For a modern version of python,
see the official `Python Installation Guide <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/>`_.

Gladier includes two main packages available through PyPi:

* Gladier -- The core development tooling for building and running flows
* Gladier Tools -- An optional set of plugable tools for common tasks

With pip installed, you can do the following:


.. code-block:: bash

   pip install gladier gladier-tools
