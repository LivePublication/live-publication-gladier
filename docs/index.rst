Welcome to Gladier's documentation!
===================================

Gladier: The Globus Architecture for Data-Intensive Experimental Research.

Gladier is a development tool for rapidly building new scientific flows for
experimental facilities. It seamlessly integrates FuncX's remote function
execution capabilities with the Globus Flows Services, enabling complete data
pipelines to be established from data capture to publication. Run your experiments,
analyze inside a super computing environment, and publish your results to Globus
Search.

For a full explanation of the Gladier architecture and API below, continue reading
the docs here. If you would like to skip ahead and play with **Examples**, there are
Binder notebooks listed below with all requirements pre-installed.
